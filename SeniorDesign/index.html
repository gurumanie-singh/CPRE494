        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-200 mb-6">
            Loading software onto aircraft is a complex process that must account for numerous design and operational
            considerations. These include strict airline procedures, certification requirements, cybersecurity concerns,
            and compatibility with existing infrastructure. Unlike everyday software deployment, aviation systems demand
            high reliability, adherence to regulatory standards, and careful planning to ensure safety and compliance.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-200 mb-6">
            The project aims to create a simplified mockup of an aircraft dataload system with added support for
            wireless dataloading. This approach provides a safe environment for exploring the technical and procedural
            challenges involved in real-world aircraft systems. Wireless dataload introduces new dimensions of
            flexibility, but it also raises additional security and feasibility concerns that must be addressed in the
            design.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-200 mb-8">
            Through this project, we gain practical exposure to key concepts such as Public Key Infrastructure
            (PKI), threat modeling, and aircraft network design. They also work with aviation-specific standards and
            protocols while learning to design within constraints such as intermittent connectivity, certification
            hurdles, and the need to align with established airline procedures. The project balances technical
            innovation with real-world limitations, offering valuable insight into the intersection of cybersecurity and
            aviation systems engineering.
